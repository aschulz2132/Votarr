Votarr is a voting (and eventually commenting) extension for search engines. It effectively turns the internet into a social media where every site is a post. 

Votarr enables people to share their previously silent opinion of each website they visit with an intuitive and unobtrusive UI. Now you can know if that sketchy site is untrusted with a quick glance at the vote count or a skim through its Votarr comments. 


Currently the source code is the front end extension built for DuckDuckGo on Firefox. A full release of the firefox extension for DuckDuckGo and the source code for Votarrs flask based backend will be available 2024-3-11.

The todo list is as follows: 
  Essential:
    - Migrate to pymongo

    - Implement user/session management
  Planned Features:
